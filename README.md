# Capital47
Cross-Border Payments with Smart Contracts and CaptialOne APIs

## Background

Cross border payments are a pain. They are slow, expensive, and opaque. We want to make them fast, cheap, and transparent. 

We are using `CapitalOne`'s `Nessie RESTful APIs` to integrate with the ACH network and EVM based `stablecoin smart contracts` to provide a transparent and secure way to send money across borders. The smart contracts are deployed on the `Hedera` testnet and the front end is deployed on Netlify.
