Cross-Border Payments with Smart Contracts and CaptialOne APIs

## Background

Cross border payments are a pain. They are slow, expensive, and opaque. We want to make them fast, cheap, and transparent. Our solution enables to rethink the way we send money across borders.

We are using `CapitalOne`'s `Nessie RESTful APIs` to integrate with the ACH network and EVM based `stablecoin smart contracts` to provide a transparent and secure way to send money across borders. The smart contracts are deployed on the `Hedera` testnet and the front end is deployed on Netlify.

## Why Hedera?

Hedera enables anyone to easily develop secure, fair, blazing-fast decentralized applications. It can be used to build stablecoins smart contracts, which are used in our project. Hedera smart contracts gas fees are very low, and it is independent of the transaction amount unlike traditional ACH network transactions.

Most importantly, Hedera is carbon-neutral and energy efficient, which is a huge plus for us.
