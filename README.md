Cross-Border Payments with Smart Contracts and CaptialOne APIs

## Background

## Streamlined Cross-Border Transactions with Blockchain and Cryptocurrencies

## 1. Traditional Cross-Border Transactions:
   - In traditional financial systems, cross-border transactions involve multiple intermediary banks, currency conversions, and can take several days to complete.
   - High fees are often associated with these transactions due to the involvement of various financial institutions and currency exchange processes.
   - Exchange rates may fluctuate, leading to uncertainty about the final amount received by the recipient.

## 2. Blockchain and Cryptocurrencies:
   - Blockchain is a decentralized and distributed ledger technology that records transactions across a network of computers in a secure and transparent manner.
   - Cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin or Ethereum, operate on blockchain technology. They are digital or virtual currencies that use cryptography for security and operate independently of a central authority.

## 3. Streamlining Cross-Border Transactions:
   - By leveraging blockchain and cryptocurrencies, cross-border transactions can be streamlined and made more efficient.
   - Cryptocurrencies can be transferred directly between users on a blockchain without the need for multiple intermediaries.
   - The decentralized nature of blockchain ensures transparency, reduces the risk of fraud, and provides a tamper-resistant record of transactions.

## 4. Benefits of Using Cryptocurrencies for Cross-Border Transactions:
   - **Speed:** Cryptocurrency transactions can be processed much faster compared to traditional bank transfers, which may take several days. Transactions on a blockchain can occur in near real-time.
   - **Cost-Effectiveness:** Cryptocurrency transactions often have lower fees compared to traditional cross-border transfers. This is because there are fewer intermediaries and less infrastructure involved.
   - **Reduced Currency Exchange Costs:** Cryptocurrencies are not tied to specific countries, reducing the need for currency conversions and associated fees.
   - **24/7 Accessibility:** Cryptocurrency transactions are not bound by banking hours or holidays, allowing users to send or receive funds at any time.


We are using `CapitalOne`'s `Nessie RESTful APIs` to integrate with the ACH network and EVM based `stablecoin smart contracts` to provide a transparent and secure way to send money across borders. The smart contracts are deployed on the `Hedera` testnet and the front end is deployed on Netlify.
